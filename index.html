      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p class="p-centered">Hi, my name is Lachie and I am currently a student studying <span style="color: #f4d676">Software Engineering</span> in Perth, Western Australia. I am passionate about learning and have previously completed a Bachelor's degree in Communications and Law. Having become interested in Computer Science during the COVID-19 lockdown period I decided to go back to university and build a solid foundation in the technical skills required to pursue a career <span style="color: #f4d676">finding solutions to problems through technology</span>. Apart from programming I also enjoy playing sport and photography. A few of my photos are hosted on this website, as well as discussions on software projects I have created.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>

      <p class="p-centered">The projects hosted on this website are written solely by myself. The purpose of hosting them on a website myself was three-fold. Firstly, for the enjoyment of learning about web development. Secondly, to showcase the technical skills I am developing as I continue to study Software Engineering. And thirdly, to create a platform that is more flexible than Github, where I can be creative in my discussion and review of each project.</p>

      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>

        <p class="p-centered">This website <span style="color: #f4d676">will undergo changes</span> as I continue to learn CSS, HMTL, Javascript, and upload new projects. Although it is acting as a platform for my student and persnal projects, it is also a project in itself and too much fun not to tinker with.</p>
