    <h2>Projects</h2>

      <p>The projects hosted on this website are written by Lachlan Greenland. They are a mix of university and personal projects. No projects have been uploaded that are ongoing. The purpose of hosting them on a website myself was three-fold. Firstly, for the enjoyment of learning about web development. Secondly, to showcase the technical skills I am developing as I continue to study Software Engineering. And thirdly, to create a platform that is more flexible than Github, where I can be creative in my discussion and review of each project.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>Hi, my name is Lachie and I am currently studing Software Engineering at Curtin University. I am passionate about learning and have previously completed a Bachelor's degree in Communications and Law. Having become interested in Computer Science during the COVID-19 lockdown period I decided to go back to university and build a solid foundation the technical skills required to pursue a career finding solutions to problems through technology. My other interests outside programming include photography and team sports.</p>

      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>

        <p>This website is self-hosted and served via a Raspberry Pi 4. It will undergo changes as I continue to learn CSS, HMTL, Javascript, and upload new projects. Although it is acting as a platform for my student and personal projects, it is also a project in itself and too much fun not to tinker with.</p>
