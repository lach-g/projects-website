The projects on hosted on this website have been written by Lachlan Greenland. They are a mix of university and personal projects. No projects have been uploaded that are ongoing. The purpose of hosting these them on a website myself was three-fold. Firstly, for the enjoying of learning about web development. Secondly, to showcase the technical skills I am developing as I continue to study Software Engineering. And thirdly, to create a platform that is more flexible than Github, where I can be creative in my discussion and review of each project.
